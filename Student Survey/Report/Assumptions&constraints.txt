Throughout the process of designing the relational database and ER diagrams, several assumptions have been made:

1. A student can take multiple surveys, but only one survey per course.

2. Each survey has a unique set of questions related to a specific course. These questions can be shared across multiple surveys for different courses.

3. Each survey question has a set of predetermined answer choices with a corresponding numeric value (e.g., Strongly agree, Agree, etc.). The answer choices are the same for all questions and surveys.

4. The survey is not anonymous, and the student's email address is used to uniquely identify a student.

5. The relationships between the entities are as follows:
   - A one-to-many relationship between Student and Survey entities, where each survey is taken by one student, and each student can take multiple surveys.
   - A many-to-many relationship between Survey and Question entities, represented by the SurveyQuestion associative entity.
   - A one-to-many relationship between SurveyQuestion and Answer entities, where each survey question can have multiple answer choices.

6. For simplicity, we have assumed that the course information (course code and title) is already stored in the database.

These assumptions have guided the design and relationships among entities in the ER diagram and relational database schema.
